# Project Explanation

This project aims to create a task management application using React. Below are the features implemented:

- **Adding a new record**: Users can add a new record to the list.
- **Length Validation**: A new record is added only if its length is less than or equal to N characters.
- **Displaying Records**: Users can view a list of added records.
- **Status Switching**: Users can toggle the status of a record between Completed and Not Completed by clicking on its name.
- **Filtering**: Records can be filtered by type (all, completed, current).
- **Task Counter**: The application displays a counter for completed and uncompleted tasks.
- **State Management**: Redux is used for state management.
- **Styling**: Any library or framework can be used for styling, but UI/UX considerations are important.
- **Linter**: The project follows the linting rules provided by [wemake-frontend-styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-frontend-styleguide).
